Hello! I'm Colin Pilloud, a software engineer from Denver. I'm an aspiring full-stack developer who specializes in Java and Ruby.

My goal here is to talk about anything interesting I run across, and maybe to document (and demonstrate!) my front-end learning process.

If you'd like, you can check out my [GitHub account](http://github.com/colinpilloud), or follow me on the [Twitters!](http://twitter.com/colinpilloud)
